    "Lifting heavy things has been a human past time across many cultures. The Scots lifted heavy stones for sport, Icelandic fisherman used rocks of various size to determine whether a man could join their fishing boat, and the American Strongmen of the late 1800s lifted an assortment of weights in various, interesting ways. I personally love exercise and I thought this dataset would be fun for my first machine learning project. I think it will give me a chance to practice various data cleaning techniques and to implement feature engineering. My goal will be to practice classification by classifying lifters by gender with a 90% accuracy."

    "The Wilks and Glossbrenn coefficients attempt to calculate a best lifter across weight classes, while the McCulloch coefficient also takes into account the age of a lifter. The IPF also has a formula that awards points based on total weight lifted with respect to bodyweight. All of these coefficients have controversial biases. I will make a new feature that uses allometric scaling to score lifters across different weightclasses against each other.

The algorithms I will test Logistic Regression (L1 and L2-regularized), Random Forest Classification and Gradient Boosting Classification. Logistic Regression is a common and fairly simple algorithm for binary classification. The L1 penalizes the absolute size of model coefficients whereas L2 penalizes the squared size. Random Forests and Gradient Boosting are more complex and robust algorithms, but in turn may be more prone to overfitting. With Random Forests I will tune the number of trees in the forest, the number of features to consider when finding the best split, and the minimum number of samples for each leaf. For Gradient Boosting I will tune the number of boosting stages to perform, the maximum depth of the regression estimators, and the learning rate which shrinks the contribution of each tree by the given amount and is a tradeoff between the number of boosting stages. \n",

    "All of the algorithms I tested performed much better than my original goal. Perhaps there is a clear distinction between male and female lifters that makes them fairly easy to distinguish. All models were essentially winners, but I went with the L2-regularized logistic regression model because it is more simple than the random forest and gradient boosting algorithms. According to the no free lunch theorem, there is no such thing as a \"best\" algorithm. It just depends on the problem at hand. \n",

The data cleaning section took a lot of investigating and going back and forth until I felt I had everything set up just right. \n",
